    "text": "This report stems from an assignment in which I used R and Quarto to analyze wine data. It consists of five different tasks, one of which involves running a regression and analyzing the outcomes. The report contains various models along with their explanations. Everything is now done in R, but it is based on previous work done in GRETL. The purpose is to understand how to perform analysis in R and produce a structured report that can be shared in various formats."

It is the preferred model.\n\nConclusion\nThis assignment looked at how different elements including age, weather, and harvest rainfall affected the wine pricing. Earlier work done with GRETL was reproduced and expanded upon using Quarto and R.\nThe first model showed a positive and significant impact of wine age on pricing.Including more variables in the second model raised the accuracy and predictability, as seen by a higher R-squared value. The third model added a dummy variable for high harvest rain, indicating how weather impacts might change based on conditions.\nThis showed how various model factors influence regression results and how R can be used to present and analyse statistical information in a structured way.

This comparatively high standard deviation indicates significant price volatility for wines, which is probably caused by a mix of aging, climate, and vintage quality.\nBefore the growing season, the average amount of WinterRain (October–March) is 608.4 mm, with a median of 600 mm and a standard deviation of 129 mm. It varies slightly between vintages, with values ranging from 376 mm to 830 mm.\nWith a mean temperature of 16.48°C and a standard deviation of 0.66°C, the growth season temperature (April–September) is mainly constant throughout the sample. The estimated temperatures range from a minimum of 14.98°C to a maximum of 17.65°C.\nThere is a higher volatility in HarvestRain (August–September), with a mean of 144.8 mm, a standard deviation of 73.07 mm, and a range of 38 mm to 292 mm. This variation raises the possibility that some vintages had unusually wet harvest seasons, which could affect the quality of the grapes.\nWith a mean of 16.19 years and a standard deviation of 8.25 years, the wine’s age in 1983 varied from 3 to 31 years. With a median age of 16, the distribution appears to be pretty symmetrical.\nIn summary, the data show that wine pricing and environment variables fluctuate significantly, while age and temperature are more evenly balanced."

The expanded model explains a greater amount of the variation in wine prices, as shown by the R-squared rising from 0.204 to 0.736. The regression’s standard error drops from 934.39 to 573.62, indicating that predictions are now more accurate.\nWhen the weather variables are included, the coefficient for age drops from 56.32 to 39.21, but it is still statistically significant. This decrease raises the possibility that the basic model overemphasized the impact of age since some variables were left out. The multiple regression model offers a more precise and trustworthy examination of the elements influencing wine pricing by incorporating the other variables."

Although its coefficient 11634.1 indicates that the expected base price is greater in years with extremely high HarvestRain, this effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.2085), therefore we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the impact of rain alone.\nWith a coefficient of -756.90, the interaction term temp_Dheavyrain shows that the price-boosting impact of temperature is less pronounced in years with high rain. This interaction implies that heavy rain lessens the value of warm growing seasons, most likely because of lower grape quality at harvest, even if it is also not statistically significant (p = 0.1790)."

This suggests that Model 2 is the one that most closely resembles the 1961 vintage’s actual market price.\nWith an R-squared of 0.736, Model 2 has the strongest explanatory power outside of residual analysis, accounting for roughly 73.6% of the variation in wine prices. Compared to Model 1’s R-squared of 0.204 and Model 3’s R-squared of 0.488, this is much higher.\nThe Model 2’s standard error was the lowest of the three explanatory factors, and all four of them—Age, HarvestRain, WinterRain, and temperature—were statistically significant.\nIn conclusion, Model 2 is the best model for forecasting Bordeaux wine prices when taking into account both the predicted accuracy for the 1961 vintage and the overall model performance."
